\title{Use decision tree to find a group of cells that are associated with clinical
outcome.}
\usage{
treeGate(P, x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{The predicted association of each cell with a clinical outcome.}

\item{x}{The marker profile of each cell. Each row is a cell, each column is
a marker. Must have length(P) rows.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed into the rpart function}
}
\value{
Returns a object created by rpart function. Also plots a graph of
  decision tree.
}
\description{
A function that sse decision tree to find a group of cells that are
associated with clinical outcome.
